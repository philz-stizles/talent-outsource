# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: tests-server

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events 
  pull_request:
  # but only for any changes to auth folder or service 'auth/**''
  # Being a microservice, were projects are independent, you only want to run
  # this test when changes are made to this service, and not when changes are 
  # made to other services,
    paths:
      - 'server/**'

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
      # create a separate script for git continuous integration testing 'test:ci'
      # our 'test' script is running jest in watcher mode(--watchAll) and it will run 
      # continuously watching for changes made to our source code. But, here, we want just
      # one run of our test script and exit immediately
        run: cd server && npm install && npm run test:ci
